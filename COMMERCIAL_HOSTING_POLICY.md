# Commercial Use Policy

This project is licensed under the **Apache License 2.0** with an additional
**License Condition** (see [LICENSE](LICENSE)).

## What the License Condition Means

The condition restricts the right to **"Sell"** the Software — meaning
providing a product or service whose value derives entirely or substantially
from this software **for profit**.

Two important clarifications:

1. **Fee vs. profit** — Charging fees to cover actual costs (hosting,
   infrastructure, maintenance) is allowed. What is restricted is
   **generating profit** from the software's functionality.

2. **Contribution threshold** — The restriction only applies when your own
   contributed or created code makes up **significantly less** than the total
   codebase. If you build substantially on top of this software and your own
   code represents the majority, you are free to commercialize without
   restriction.

## What Is Allowed

- **Personal use** — running the software for yourself or your friends
- **Community / guild / clan use** — non-commercial servers for members
- **Cost-recovery hosting** — charging users a fee that covers server and
  infrastructure costs, as long as you are not profiting
- **Modifications & forks** — you may modify and redistribute freely
- **Building products** — if your own code is the substantial majority of the
  product (e.g. a game that incorporates the mechanics), you may sell it freely
- **Internal organizational use** — as long as the software itself is not
  the product being sold for profit
- **Streaming / content creation** — monetizing content that uses the
  software is fine

## What Is NOT Allowed (Without Permission)

- **Hosting for profit** — running the software as a service and charging
  more than your actual costs
- **Reselling** — distributing copies of the software (modified or not) for
  profit when your own contributions are minimal
- **Managed instances for profit** — offering the software as a SaaS/hosted
  product and profiting from it

## Examples

| Company uses it internally (no revenue from it) | Yes |
| Streamer monetizes content using the software | Yes |
| Hosting provider sells managed instances for profit | No — requires permission |
